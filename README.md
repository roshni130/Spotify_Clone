Introduction
I developed a Spotify clone webpage designed to provide a seamless and intuitive music streaming experience. The webpage is divided into three main sections: the sidebar menu, main content area, and the music player.
Each section is thoughtfully crafted to mimic the features and functionalities of Spotify, ensuring users can easily navigate and enjoy their favorite music and podcasts.

Section 1: Sidebar Menu
The first section features a sidebar menu, which includes:
  a.  A search button for finding music and podcasts.
  b.  Options to create new playlists.
  c.  A playlist library for accessing existing playlists.
  d.  A browse feature for discovering new podcasts.
  e.  Additional options for easy navigation and quick access to various features.

Section 2: Main Content
The second section is dedicated to the main content, offering:
 a.  A list of recently played songs for quick access.
 b.  Names of artists whose songs you like the most, tailored to your preferences.
 c.  An option to view top songs in India, updated regularly.
 d.  Additional options for personalized music recommendations and curated playlists, ensuring a tailored listening experience.

 Section 3: Music Player
 a.  The final section is the music player, providing:
 b.  Play and pause controls for seamless playback.
 c.  Sound control buttons for adjusting volume to your preference.
